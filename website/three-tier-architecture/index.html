              This is a Three-Tier Architecture, containing a Presentation
              tier, an Application tier and a Data tier. The presentation tier
              contains the user-facing elements. The application tier contains
              the back end, which will also contain the application code (not
              present here). And the data tier, containg the application's
              data, normally in the form of a database.
            </p>

            <p>
              A three-tier architecture makes the system more organised and
              more easily maintainable. Each tier can be developed and scaled
              independently based on requirements. This architecture also
              provides increased security, the database can be isolated behind
              additional layers of security provided by the front end.
            </p>
            <p>
              This architecture has high availability and fault tolerance
              built into it as it is spread across different availability
              zones, and it uses a load balancer and auto scaling. This means
              disruption will be kept to a minimum by the automatic
              provisioning of resources to ensure the application always has
              the right amount of capacity to handle current demand.

          <ol>
            <li>
              I built a VPC across two availability zones, with one public
              subnet and two private subnets for each tier, in each
              availability zone. With one public route table that connects the
              public subnets to an internet gateway. For the public subnets, I
              enabled auto-assign public IPv4 address, to enable access via
              the internet.
            </li>
            <li>
              I created a NAT gateway in each availability zone to allow
              instances from the private subnets to connect to resources
              outside of the VPC, to the internet. This is necessary to
              perform services such as package updates or installation of
              patches. To maintain high availability it is best practice to
              deploy NAT gateways in each of the public subnets. When you
              create a NAT Gateway you must assign an elastic IP address to
              it.
            </li>
            <li>
              A default route table has been created for each private subnet.
              I deleted 3 of them and used one and explicitly associated that
              with all four private subnets. I then added a route to the NAT
              Gateway.
            </li>
            <li>
              The presentation tier is where the application is delivered for
              users to interact with, hosted on EC2 instances. I created a
              launch template that was used by the Auto Scaling Group to
              dynamically launch EC2 instances into the public subnets. In the
              launch template I created a new security group with inbound SSH,
              HTTP and HTTPS rules. In the Instance user data I added some
              code to install an Apache web server displaying a basic HTML
              page.
            </li>
            <li>
              To ensure high availability and limit single points of failure I
              created an auto scaling group that could dynamically provision
              EC2 instances when needed across multiple availability in the
              public subnets.
            </li>
            <li>
              I created an application load balancer to distribute incoming
              HTTP traffic to EC2 instances. This was configured to be an
              internet-facing load balancer, which means it listens for HTTP/S
              requests. I then attached the security group I created to the
              load balancer. I then configured the load balancer to listen
              over HTTP on port 80 and routed it to a target group, to route
              to the EC2 instances.
            </li>
            <li>
              When creating the autoscaling group I added a dynamic scale and
              policy that tells it when to scale up or down. I configured this
              to monitor CPU usage and to create more instances when usage was
              above 50%. I set the desired capacity on the autoscaling group
              to 2 instances and the maximum capacity to 5. 2 instances were
              immediately deployed.
            </li>
            <li>
              When visiting the public DNS of the application load balancer,
              the web page was displayed, meaning the load balancer was
              routing traffic correctly. I was also able to successfully SSH
              into the EC2 instance.
            </li>
            <li>
              The application tier, also often known as the logic tier, is the
              heart of the application. Containing the application code, and
              being at the center of operations, it will send and receive data
              to and from the presentation tier and the data tier. The setup
              was much the same as with the presentation tier, but included a
              connection from a Bastion host, an EC2 instance set up in the
              presentation tier to allow for private connection to the
              internet, by authorized users, using SSH.
            </li>
            <li>
              In the launch template, the backend EC2 instances were set up
              using the same settings as the frontend instances, but the
              security group was set up differently, to make public access
              impossible. I also set it to allow SSH and ICMP from the
              presentation tier, by using the security group in the
              presentation tier as the source of the connection. In the
              instance user data, I entered a script to install the MySQL
              package, to allow for later connection to the database in the
              data tier.
            </li>
            <li>
              I then created an auto scaling group using the private subnets,
              and an internal application load balancer, routing traffic from
              the presentation tier rather than the public internet, using the
              launch template created above as the target. Two new instances
              were then automatically created, running in the private subnets.
            </li>
            <li>
              I was then able to use SSH to connect to one of the presentation
              tier servers, and from there ping an application server,
              confirming that the connection works.
            </li>
            <li>
              For the bastion host, I created a new instance in a public
              subnet (presentation tier) and attached a security group
              allowing only SSH, through the source ‘My IP’. I then edited the
              security group inbound rules of an instance in the application
              tier, allowing an SSH connection from the bastion host security
              group.
            </li>
            <li>
              To connect to the private application server through the bastion
              host, I needed to use SSH Agent Forwarding, which provided
              access to the keys required to authenticate and then establish
              the connection. I was then able to connect, via SSH, from the
              bastion host public IP address, to the application instance
              private IP address.
            </li>
            <li>
              The data tier of a three-tier application is crucial for
              providing data persistence, for any kind of situation depending
              on the nature of the application. This could include login
              information, user registration details, data regarding
              transactions, financial information, high scores, application
              configuration…. There are many options for how to store data,
              and in this architecture I used Amazon RDS for MySQL.
            </li>
            <li>
              I first created a database security group, allowing inbound and
              outbound traffic running to and from the servers running in the
              application tier, over port 3306, the source being the
              application security group. I then created a database subnet
              group in the VPC, spanning two private subnets, running over two
              availability zones.
            </li>
            <li>
              I then created the RDS database, running in a single
              availability zone. For best practice you would enable Multi-AZ
              deployment, providing the database with high availability and
              automatic failover depending on configuration. You can then also
              create read replicas for more efficient read queries.
            </li>
            <li>
              As the MySQL package was installed on the server, I then was
              able to connect to the database through SSH using the database
              endpoint.
            </li>
          </ol>
